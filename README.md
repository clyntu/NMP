## Summary
Machine learning based prediction of MIDI signals for networked music performance applications. Networked Music Performance (NMP) aims at revolutionizing the traditional concept of musical interaction by enabling remote musicians to interact and perform together through a telecommunication network. Ensuring realistic performative conditions constitutes a significant challenge due to very strict requirements in terms of audio quality and network delay. Such requirements are rarely met in todayâ€™s Internet. When an audio signal is streamed from source to destination it is split into packets and delivered with an unavoidable delay due to transmission medium, plus a variable jitter. Therefore, some or most packets may not reach the destination in time causing gasps in the audio playback. This thesis proposes the adoption of machine learning techniques to conceal missing packets carrying MIDI audio signals, by predicting future events that will be generated by the MIDI source.
